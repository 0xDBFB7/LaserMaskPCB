Matte paint on copper:

100mm - 0.2 - incomplete removal.
500mm - 0.1 - dot size has a big effect on the amount of residue that remains.
1000mm - 0.1 - when fully dried, you can brush the residue off.

Paint must be fully dried before etching - 70c for 20 minutes seems to do it.

White masking tape on copper:

500mm - dot size 0.1 - Traces gummed with adhesive.
800 - Same.
1200 - right out. Completely covered traces.

Kapton Polyimide on copper:

1000 "cuts" with a thick black trace - but does not cleanly go through.

Even 100/100 is unable to puncture reliably. Higher power densities appear 
to just cause a buildup of white material.

Dry film negative resist:

1500 - 100 - nice purple color, but it burned right through.
2000 - 40 - Works really well.
2000 - 30 - 0.08 Again, works really well. 

Three minutes in a tablespoon of washing soda developer seems to work.

20 seconds at "rayon" seems to fuse.

Buna-N rubber:

300 - 100 - 0.08 - not all the way through - pretty smokey.
100 - 100 - 0.08 - 2 passes - Still only a quarter of the way through.
100 - 100 - 0.08 - 7 passes - Only half way through.
20 - 100 = 0.08 - 2 passes - most of the way through, but the Buna changed
texture completely in a manner that I think makes it unsuitable for gaskets.
